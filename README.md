# obj-cgf

OBJ parser for WebCGF.
This project outputs the arrays of vertex, normals and indexes corresponding to the data in an OBJ file. Thus, you can model something in a 3D modelling program such as Blender and and import it easily into WebCGF.

Although developed during a university course, this was an extra-curricular project unrelated to the authors' evaluation.

## WebCGF

WebCGF is a library used during the academic year of 2016/2017 in the Graphics Computation (CGRA) course at FEUP's Computer Engineering BSc+MSc, through which students develop a graphical scene. You can find it here: https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ruirodrig/pub/sw/webcgf/docs/
